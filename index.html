      <p>Are you interested in a career in health care? If so, which field and why?:
        <ul>
          <li>In a technical aspect (i.e., software or design), sure! Though not as a medical practitioner. </li>
          <li>One of the most beautiful uses of design and technology I have ever seen is the <a href='http://www3.gehealthcare.com/en/Products/Categories/Accessories_and_Supplies/Adventure_Series_for_CT/Pirate_Island'>CT Pirate Island Adventure</a>. Long story short, children were so nervous that they had trouble staying still when given CT scans. This would interfere with the machine&#39;s ability to do what it&#39;s supposed to, and the children would have to be sedated. GE invented a series of CT scanners where the process would become a game for the child to &#39;play.&#39; (&quot;Please don&#39;t move when you get under the tunnel, or the other pirates will hear you!&quot; Kid stays still and the scan is taken successfully. Sometimes kids even ask to take the CT again!) Beautiful display of how art and technology can transform scary exams into fun activities.</li>
        </ul>

      <div class='spacer'></div>
      <p>I heard about Footprints from <strong>Ariel Wiener</strong></p>

      <div class='spacer'></div>
      <p><em>Why are you interested in being a part of this program and what do you hope to get out of this program?</em></p>
      <p>There are some experiences at UF that go beyond the call of action. These groups find a way for us to change a life. They open us to levels of vulnerability and human connection, levels that go so far past our comfort zones that the zones become invisible to us, even with telescopes. Experiences that challenge us and shape us and mold us and break us down and build us up. Experiences that make us laugh after they make us cry. That make us happy to stay overtime. That can never be encaptured by a line on a resume or a single story.</p>
      <p>Footprints to me is one of these experiences.</p>
      <p>I don&#39;t know what I expect to get out of Footprints. I&#39;d hate to sketch out my rough ideas with letters and words because they would just sound silly. It&#39;s hardly relevant, though. I do not want to do Footprints because of what I would get out of it. That seems hardly fair to the children, who need it miles more than I do. I hope to give to this program much more than I can carry away with these hands.</p>

      <div class='spacer'></div>
      <p><em>What do you hope to bring to this program?</em></p>
      <p>I hope to bring a hundred silly puns. I hope to bring a video game partner. I hope to bring a silent ear when needed. I hope to bring an escape from the intimidating sense of sterilization that hospitals are far too capable of imposing. I hope to bring singing in the halls. I promise to bring a Disney movie. I also promise to bring a positive attitude and tons and tons and tons and tons and tons and tons and tons and tons and tons and tons and tons and tons and tons of energy.</p>
      <p>Also, I would be absolutely thrilled to build Footprints a website for free. You do an amazing service, and deserve to have a way for people to see that. Whether or not I am accepted as a volunteer, please reach out to me about it.</p>


      <div class='spacer'></div>
      <p>I am <strong>not</strong> committed elsewhere that would hinder my flexibility</p>


      <div class='spacer'></div>
      <p><em>Are you a part of, or familiar with, any community organizations that would be good candidates to team up with for such events? Any ideas for other such community outreach events?</em>
        <ul>
          <li>Gainesville Harvest? Every semester, they throw a large event that benefits local lower-income families. The last one was in Bo Diddley Plaza and from what I understand filled the place.</li>
          <li>Phi Mu Alpha does this thing called a &quot;Mills Music Mission,&quot; where we go to places that need music and sing for free. We are always looking for new places to go.</li>
        </ul>
